The ocean covers more than 70% of our planet, yet much of it remains unexplored. Beneath the surface lies a world teeming with life, from microscopic plankton to massive whales. Deep-sea trenches plunge into darkness, where strange and bioluminescent creatures thrive under extreme pressure. Despite its vastness, the ocean is fragile, facing threats like pollution, overfishing, and climate change. Protecting this mysterious and vital ecosystem is essential for maintaining Earth's balance and biodiversity.
